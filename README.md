# OpenPort-Finder-2.0
#This code uses the scapy library to send a SYN packet to a specified IP address and port, and receives a response. If the response is not None, the port is considered to be open. If the response is None, the port is considered to be closed. This can be useful for identifying open ports on a network.

#To use this code to scan for open ports on a network, you'll need to have the scapy library installed. You can install scapy using pip, the Python package manager, by running pip install scapy.
